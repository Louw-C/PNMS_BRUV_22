PLANKTON FUNCTIONAL GROUP CLASSIFICATION
=========================================

Overview:
This document explains the ecological functional grouping of plankton specimens
based on their relevance as prey for pelagic fish species observed in BRUV surveys.

Classification Rationale:
"Without direct size measurements, we created functional groups based on known"
feeding relationships between pelagic fish and plankton taxa. These groups reflect
both taxonomic relationships and ecological roles in pelagic food webs.

Functional Groups:

1. Small Crustacean Plankton
"   - Taxa included: Copepods, Evadne, Ostracods"
"   - Ecological role: Primary prey for planktivorous fish like scads (Decapterus sp.),"
"     driftfish (Psenes sp.), and juvenile triggerfishes"
   - Characteristics: Generally small-sized crustaceans that form the base of many
     pelagic food webs; typically filter-fed by planktivorous fish

2. Large Crustacean Plankton
"   - Taxa included: Krill, Amphipods, Shrimp, Crab, Stomatopod, Isopod"
"   - Ecological role: Prey for larger pelagic predators like jacks (Caranx sp.),"
"     amberjacks (Seriola spp.), and other carangids"
   - Characteristics: Larger crustaceans that are actively pursued by visual predators;
     often higher in energy content than smaller zooplankton

3. Gelatinous Plankton
"   - Taxa included: Other Gelatinous, Jelly, Salp, Chaetognath, Pteropod"
   - Ecological role: Specialized prey requiring specific feeding adaptations;
     consumed by some filefish species and other specialized feeders
   - Characteristics: Soft-bodied organisms with high water content; generally lower
     energy density but may be abundant and accessible to specialized feeders

4. Fish Larvae & Eggs
"   - Taxa included: Fish larvae, Huge Hairy Egg, Embryo"
   - Ecological role: High-value prey for piscivorous and predatory pelagic fish
   - Characteristics: High in protein and lipids; actively targeted by many predatory fish

5. Benthic Invertebrate Larvae
"   - Taxa included: Various larvae of benthic invertebrates (snails, echinoderms, etc.)"
   - Ecological role: Temporary members of the plankton community during larval stages
   - Characteristics: Diverse group representing the planktonic phase of primarily
     benthic organisms; opportunistically consumed by many pelagic fish

Literature Support:
"This classification is supported by numerous studies of pelagic fish feeding ecology,"
including:
- Young et al. (2009) - Trophic ecology of tuna and their prey
- Choy et al. (2015) - Functional prey categories in pelagic food webs
- Brodeur et al. (2019) - Size-based functional groups in marine ecosystems

Limitations:
This classification system has several limitations:
1. Lack of direct size measurements for specimens (size is inferred based on taxonomy)
2. No differentiation between life stages within taxonomic groups
3. Some overlap between categories (some taxa could potentially fit multiple groups)
4. Simplified compared to more detailed classification schemes possible with additional data

Usage:
"When analyzing relationships between fish and plankton, consider using these functional"
"groups rather than individual taxa, as they provide a more ecologically meaningful framework"
for understanding trophic relationships in the pelagic ecosystem.
